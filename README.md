## parse-xplore: Exploring morphological and syntactic parsers

In this repo, we explore various morphological and syntactic parsers, like
Stanza, Flair, SuPar and (in future) beyond.

We met various obstacles while trying to use these libraries, but found a way
out, so we want to share our experience to possibly save you some time.

Here we provide Jupyter notebooks with detailed instructions that anyone can
use to train custom models on custom data using these libraries.
